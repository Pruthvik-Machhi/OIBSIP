##  Streamlit App Development

- **Front-end Development:** Creating an interactive user interface (UI) using Streamlit components.
- **Integration:** Integrating machine learning models and data processing pipelines into the Streamlit app.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the app to a Streamlit cloud platform  for easy access and sharing.

Building the Streamlit app allowed me to hone my skills in web development, UI design, and model deployment.
